    <h4 id="recitation">Recitation</h4>

    <p>This assignment asks you to read (in Latin and out loud!) any of Pliny’s letters in our textbook. You will be evaluated based on your pronunciation and your phrasing, with brownie points for tone and inflection. The letter can be as short or as long as you wish; the only requirement is that it be a full letter, rather than a section of a letter. You do NOT need to memorize; you can have the text in front of you, marked however you’d like to help with your reading. You can either do this live via a one-on-one Zoom meeting or via an audio or video recording. More specific guidelines to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="word-study">Word Study</h4>

    <p>You will choose one word and trace it (and any of its declensions or conjugations) throughout Pliny’s letters through methods and tools that I will demonstrate for you. How often does the word appear? When is a noun used as a subject versus a direct object? When is a verb used in the subjunctive versus the indicative? More specific guidelines to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="reverse-translation">Reverse Translation</h4>

    <p>I will provide a translation of one of Pliny’s letters and ask you to evaluate it. Is the translator faithful to the actual Latin words and constructions? Does the translator capture Pliny’s tone well? Is the translation still comprehensible to a 21st century audience? If not, can you translate the translation into modern English that we can understand? More specific guidelines to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="response-composition">Response Composition</h4>

    <p>This assignment asks you to compose (in Latin) a response of 6-10 sentences to any of Pliny’s letters. More specific guidelines to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="response-translation">Response Translation</h4>

    <p>You will be assigned another student’s response composition, and you will be asked to translate it! More specific guidelines to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="midterm">Midterm</h4>

    <p>The midterm will be an open-note, open-book, open-Internet exam that you will complete outside of class by <strong>DUE DATE HERE</strong>. It will include morphological and grammar questions, translation prompts, and comprehension questions. More details to come.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 id="final">Final: Write Your Own Exam</h4>

    <p>For the final, <strong>you</strong> will write your own exam! By having you peruse your own notes and assignments to come up with questions and prompts, you'll gain a greater appreciation of what we're doing in this course and identify what's become important to you as we've learned to read more Latin.</p>
    <p>The final exam will consist of two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(5%) First, based on guidelines that I will provide, you will write your own exam and send it to me by <strong>DUE DATE HERE</strong>. Then, <em>I will actually take your exam as if I were your student and then submit my exam back to you!</em></li>
      <li>(5%) Second, you will <strong>grade</strong> my exam (I will purposefully try to get some questions wrong), and then submit your corrections back to me.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More details to come.</p>
